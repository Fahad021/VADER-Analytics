# Machine Learning Power Flow

This package uses a Support Vector Regression in place of the physical powerflow equations to model the relationships between power and voltage in an electricity distribution network. The work is published in the proceedings of NAPS 2017 as "Robust mapping rule estimation for power flow analysis in distribution grids" by Jiafan Yu, Yang Weng, and Ram Rajagopal.
