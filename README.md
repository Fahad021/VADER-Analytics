# VADER-Analytics
Visualization and Analytics for Distributed Energy Resources

### Introduction
VADER is a collection of analytics developed from the ground up to enable utilities to have greater visibility
into distributed energy resources. Weâ€™ve built several batch- and stream-analytics in VADER that help operators better understand the impact of distributed energy resources on the grid. Each of these analytics shares a common data infrastructure referred to as VADER Data Platform.

Refer to [BACKGROUND.md](../master/docs/BACKGROUND.md) for more information on project background and the problems we're trying to solve.
